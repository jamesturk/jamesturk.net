I've been wanting to write more for a while, and so decided to rebuild this site.

When I came across [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for course notes a few months ago, I really liked working with it.
If you haven't seen it, it's somewhere between traditional documentation tools like Sphinx and Jupyter notebooks.
Quarto supports .qmd files, which are markdown files with the ability to run code inline and embed the output like a Jupyter notebook.

Quarto has been a real pleasure to use, here's a code block with its output:
 

```{python}
# draw ascii pyramid
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(" " * ((10 - i) // 2) + "*" * i)
```

There's a great [VSCode Extension](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html) that enables live preview and code execution.

I'm hoping to start writing more explorations like the recent posts about scraping with GPT ([Part 1](/posts/scraping-with-gpt-4/), [Part 2](/posts/scraping-with-gpt-part-2/)).
I think the ability to embed code and output will lower the barrier to writing.

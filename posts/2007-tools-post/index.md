*[This is an old post from a blog I had in 2007, I put it up here for posterity.  I'll write a 2015 version eventually to compare.]*

**Hardware:** My laptop is a [PowerPro J 10:15](http://powernotebooks.com/specs/PowerPro/j10-15.php), which is a Compal IFL90 sold by the great people at PowerPro.  I bought my first laptop from them years ago and it served me amazingly well, and when it came time last month to replace it, I went back to them (I'm not a huge fan of their site, but once you get past that they have a well deserved great reputation).  One of the most important things for me was that I could buy it without an OS installed, but their service and support is amazing, and the IFL90 is a nice looking notebook that has been performing amazingly well.

My mp3 player is a iRiver IHP-120 which has served me amazingly well for the last four years.  It's probably the oldest gadget I still actually use, but I use it constantly and despite looking pretty beat up it works about as well as it did the day I got it.  Actually even better since being loaded with the [rockbox](http://rockbox.org) custom firmware.

I also have a 22" widescreen monitor that I got at an extreme discount but never actually use.  In theory it was a second monitor for my laptop but in practice it sits unplugged in my room since I never got in the habit of using it.

**OS:** Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon)  I've used every edition of Ubuntu since 4.10, and it has been my primary OS since 5.04.  When I got this laptop I left some unpartitioned space in case I decided to install Windows, but on my old laptop I hadn't booted into the windows partition in about a year, so I'm not really sure if I'll ever even bother.

**Browser:** Firefox.  Notable extensions include Greasemonkey, Firebug, and the Web Developer Toolbar.  I also use the Gmail Notifier, del.icio.us toolbar, and ForecastFox.

**Development:** For quick editing, I use GEdit or vim depending on the context.  When I'm working on a real project lately I've been happy with [Komodo Edit] (http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_edit/), the free version of the Komodo IDE.  It has great Python support and is simple enough to be usable as opposed to a full blown IDE like Eclipse/PyDev.  When I was using Java I did use Eclipse, but I feel that lightweight languages deserve lightweight editors.  I also find [Meld](http://meld.sourceforge.net/) to be an invaluable tool, both for examining local files and using as an aid when dealing with directories under revision control (an oft-overlooked feature)

**Media:** I do actually still buy CDs, which I then rip with ripperX seeing as it just works where sound-juicer and others either aren't flexible enough or take far too much configuration.  I tag/organize things with easyTag and then play them with the terrific KDE music app amaroK.  VLC is a must for playing videos/DVDs.  On the rare occasions where I'm creating something I either fire up the old standby Gimp, or use the SVG drawing tool Inkscape, which has allowed me to make things that looked nice with my severely limited artistic talent.

**Everything Else:** I use Pidgin to stay in touch with people. From time to time I still fire up OpenOffice although I have been transitioning to Google Docs.  When I'm writing things for school I prefer to use LaTeX and I typically do my editing in Kile, a superb KDE LaTeX editor.   Google handles my email/calendaring needs (but I do have my GooCal imported into Evolution for it's nice Gnome integration. [Gnome Do](http://do.davebsd.com/), Tomboy, and Compiz's window grouping plugin all deserve a mention here as well.

Earlier today I noticed an email I was looking up was from exactly three years ago.  From there I wound up on a random path that had me reading emails from February 24th for the past 6 years. It wound up being a pretty interesting look at what I've been doing over the last few years that I thought I'd write up for my own benefit.

So, starting in 2005 here's what was going on in my life on February 24th:

  * In 2005 my Gmail account was fairly new and hardly used.  Further evidencing how new Gmail was the only notable email from 6 years ago is a Gmail invitation I sent my Dad.
  * In 2006 I was corresponding with several progressive clubs at [RIT](http://rit.edu) to organize an event to up membership at all of our clubs.  I was particularly happy to be reminded of this workas organizing that event remains my favorite thing that I did as the president of the RIT College Democrats. Another related memory was that I ended up writing a Jeopardy game in [PyGame](http://pygame.org) with trivia from the various clubs (notable as it was one of my first times writing anything more than a simple script in Python).
  * Apparently I picked a pretty interesting day to do this:  While reading emails from 2007 I realized that four years ago I had just finalized my start date for my internship at [Sunlight Labs](http://sunlightlabs.com).  It is hard to believe this was four years ago, I've been working for Sunlight ever since in some capacity.
  * 2008 doesn't quite live up to previous two years. Nothing much happened, I donated a small amount to the Obama campaign and an old boss was on his way out and there were a few emails regarding his departure.
  * In 2009 I was working on plans for PyCon 2009 where we hosted our first [Open Government Hackathon](http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2009/open-government-hackathon-chicago/).  This also happens to be one of my favorite events that I've helped to plan (apparently in February I'm all about the planning).
  * Last year, as evidenced by a higher-than-usual number of pull requests on the [Open States Project](http://openstates.sunlightlabs.com) I was actually at our second PyCon hackathon.
  * Today I'm in Raleigh attending [CAR 2011](http://www.ire.org/training/conference/CAR11/).  I'm giving a talk on "Mobile Apps for Investigations" which will mainly focus on the [Recovery.gov LayAR](http://www.ire.org/training/conference/CAR11/) I made a while ago.

    This has been fun, I'm curious how lucky I got as it seems like I picked a few pretty significant days.  If you've never tried this before I'd recommend giving it a try, just go to Gmail and use the extra options (click "Show search options") to look at some specific day.  If you use Gmail as much as I have for these last few years it'll at least prove an interesting trip down memory lane.

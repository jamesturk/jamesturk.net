I tend to release a lot of my work as open source projects. 

I'm primarily a Python developer, but have worked on projects in C, C++, Go, Rust, JavaScript, C#, and Lua.

## Active Projects

At any given time I'm generally thinking about/actively working on a few projects.

Here are the currently active ones:

### scrapeghost

[scrapeghost](https://jamesturk.github.io/scrapeghost/)

Experimental library for webscraping with GPT.

I've been experimenting with using LLMs like GPT to convert HTML into JSON.

### jellyfish

[jellyfish](https://jamesturk.github.io/jellyfish/)

Fast implementations of common fuzzy string comparison and phonetic encoding algorithms.

This project was created by my former colleague, Michael Stephens, back in 2010.
Since then it's grown to be a widely-used library, in part due to the fact that it offerred fast C implementations of these algorithms.

Years ago I wrote Go & Rust implementations of the algorithms as a way to learn a bit more about both languages.  I've just recently decided to make the Rust implementation the official one, using [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/).

I also plan to keep the Go implementation around as a reference implementation. [go-jellyfish](https://github.com/jamesturk/go-jellyfish/)

### spatula

[spatula](https://jamesturk.github.io/spatula/)

After spending over a decade writing (and perhaps more importantly, maintaining) scrapers in Python, I have some opinions about how to structure them.

Spatula is a library that I've been working on to help me write scrapers in a more consistent way.

## Stable Projects

These projects are mostly dormant, but stable & maintained as needed.

* [scrapelib](https://jamesturk.github.io/scrapelib/)
* [django-honeypot](https://github.com/jamesturk/django-honeypot)
* [django-markupfield](https://github.com/jamesturk/django-markupfield)

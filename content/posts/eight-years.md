(*this post is about my employment at Sunlight, but is in no way a reflection of anything but my own personal sentiment*)

### May 29th, 2007

I'd been living in DC for a little under a week. I already liked it quite a bit, which was lucky as I'd made plans to move there sight unseen.

In December of 2006 I'd accepted a position with [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com), an up-and-coming nonprofit with a mission I cared about and which already seemed to place an importance on technology.  In fact my position was listed as being within [Sunlight Labs, "a Sunlight foundation pilot project to prototype tech ideas"](https://web.archive.org/web/20060820042725/http://www.sunlightlabs.com/).

Since then I'd been working at a mind-numbing job in Rochester making more money than I'd ever made before.  The idea was to save enough I could afford to live in DC on my intern stipend.  There were certainly times I questioned if it'd all be worth it.

I got pretty lucky.  It was.

### The Next Eight Years

From my initial time as an intern, to leading the Open States project from a remote office in Boston, to my time as Director of Sunlight Labs, Sunlight was been an amazing place for me.

Sunlight is the place that...


* I launched my [first project](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012015945/http://earmarkwatch.org/) back in 2007.

* made it possible for us to take what we called the [Fifty States Project](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2009/02/26/fifty-state-project/) at PyCon 2009 to [OpenStates.org](http://openstates.org), one of Sunlight's biggest projects.

* when life had me moving to Boston, allowed me to open a small Boston office.  (That's the team that ultimately made Open States what it is today.)

* allowed me to meet and collaborate with like-minded civic hackers all around the world.

* let me work with some of the best, smartest, most passionate people I'll ever meet.

### Moving On

So in June when it became clear to me that it was time to move on, I did so with a heavy heart but also eight years of fond memories, great experience, and wonderful friends.

And to all of you that made Sunlight such a wonderful eight years &mdash; coworkers, collaborators, peers, users, friends &mdash; thank you.

And please, [stay in touch.](mailto:james.p.turk@gmail.com)

Last week, Sunlight published a [blog post](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/) that has been described as "[unusual](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/09/sunlight-foundation-shut-down-mike-klein-228422)".  Though many of us took it to mean Sunlight was effectively shutting down we've since learned that it will only be the end of Sunlight Labs for now.  All the same, it is clear that while there may be a Sunlight Foundation a year from now it will be a very different place from the one I spent 8 years at.

I felt like I should write something but I wasn't sure what was left to say:

* My [post from last year](/posts/eight-years/) reflected upon what my time there meant to me.  
* Seamus Kraft [collected some fond memories](https://medium.com/@seamuskraft/sunlight-memories-2ecc8b374881) from others.
* Nathaniel Heller gave a [pretty accurate assessment](http://integrilicio.us/blog/2016/9/26/the-most-frustrating-things-about-sunlights-sun-setting) of many of the internal issues that led to last week's announcement.

I've also seen some people speculating on the future of civic tech based on this, and I'll leave that to them, adding only that (having experienced much of it firsthand) it is hard to overstate how enormous the human factor was in this particular case.  I'm therefore a bit skeptical of painting the troubles of Sunlight with a brush wide enough to color other civic tech ventures.

So I feel like there isn't much to add, but I will say that I am proud that nearly all of the work Sunlight Labs did was [open source](http://github.com/sunlightlabs/) and as [labs director Kat Duffy wrote](https://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/21/whats-next-for-sunlight-labs/), the community will be able to adopt projects.

Of course, a project that holds a special place for me is Open States.  It's been over a year since I've touched Open States and I wasn't sure if people would still care.  As soon as Mike's announcement went live though ...

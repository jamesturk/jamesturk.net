Whenever I've had a personal site I've always found myself paralyzed by the idea of who my audience is or should be and how it defines what I write.  At some point a couple years ago I decided I didn't really feel like maintaining a personal server and let my sporadically updated personal site disappear with a whimper.  I don't think anyone cared, especially not me.

Now for some unknown reason I've wound up with the desire for yet another personal site.  Right now I'm experimenting with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) platform, and I'm liking what it has to offer.  While experimenting, I thought it'd be helpful to test it with a few older posts, and I decided to leave them up.

Each of them was sort of interesting to me in a terribly embarassing to read/navel-gazing kind of way:

* [the tools I used 7 years ago](/the-obligatory-tools-post-2007/)
* [my public declaration to no longer think of myself as primarily a C++ developer](/farewell-cpp-2/)
* [wrapping up school](/reflections-on-four-years/) 
* [the very first presentation I gave on what has become my job for the past 7 years](/rochester-barcamp-3-developers-can-change-the-world/)
* [an arbitrary reflection on February 24th](/today-in-history-feb-24/)
* [my decision to move to Boston three years ago](/north/)

Tired of all the consistency in how news organizations spell the name of that one Libyan dictator?

Worry no more because now there's a script that'll randomize all appearances of his name.  Inspiration taken from a [Stack Overflow question about a regex for his name](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5365283/regular-expression-to-search-for-gadaffi).

To install simply visit [that libyan dictator userscript](https://gist.github.com/raw/879641/f0f5fd5abe429ccda27232925f6be033f5ba1385/that_libyan_dictator.user.js) in Chrome (or Firefox with GreaseMonkey installed).  It'll ask if you want to install it, click yes and then continue reading the news with just a bit more variety.

I personally recommend visiting [his wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi) to make sure it is installed properly.

Note: there's also a certain [easter egg](https://skitch.com/mikejs/ri386/cnn.com-breaking-news-u.s-world-weather-entertainment-and-video-news) that'll pop up from time to time.  ([inspiration](http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/03/its_time_to_play_sheen_beck_or.html))

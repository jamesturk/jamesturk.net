### May 29th, 2007

I'd been living in DC for two days. I already liked it quite a bit, which was lucky as I'd made plans to move there sight unseen.

In December of 2006 I'd accepted a position with [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com), an up-and-coming nonprofit with a mission I cared about and which already seemed to place an importance on technology.  In fact my position was listed as being within [Sunlight Labs, "a Sunlight foundation pilot project to prototype tech ideas"](https://web.archive.org/web/20060820042725/http://www.sunlightlabs.com/).

Since then I'd been working at a mind-numbing job in Rochester making more money than I'd ever made before.  The idea was to save enough I could afford to live in DC on my intern stipend.  There were certainly times I questioned if it'd all be worth it.

I got pretty lucky.  It was.

### Interning

My first day started out with me in an office of people I'd never spoken to (the person that hired me had moved on before I arrived).  This could have been an intimidating experience, or even a disaster (*yeah... we don't have any record of you working here, thanks for coming down*). 

Instead, it turned into an incredible experience.  I was treated like a key part of the team, spent most of my time writing code, and had very few "intern" duties (I did spend time building the conference room tables though).  Along with [Jeremy Carbaugh](https://jcarbaugh.com) I helped Sunlight transition into a Python & [Django](https://djangoproject.com) shop.  We also started releasing all of our code as [Open Source](https://github.com/sunlightlabs), an important step towards making Sunlight the place it is today.

I launched my [first project](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012015945/http://earmarkwatch.org/) and helped maintain Sunlight's flagship API.

I was incredibly happy with where I'd landed.

I guess they were happy too, When I left to go back to school I stayed on as a part-time consultant, continuing a lot of the work I'd started over the summer.

### A Real Job

After almost a year of remote work and a few overnight Rochester to DC drives I was done with school and going to be starting full time.  I already felt like part of the team, and was incredibly glad to have the opportunity to be back among everyone in DC.

The next couple of years were pretty great, in addition to taking ownership Sunlight's API, I worked on dozens of smaller projects, the revitalized [SunlightLabs.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090201120721/http://sunlightlabs.com/), and helped kick off the [Fifty States Project]() at PyCon 2009.
